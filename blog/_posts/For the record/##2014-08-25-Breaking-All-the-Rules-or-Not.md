「找寻出固定模式是人类基本的认知功能之一。」擅长识别特定模式让大脑能节约更多资源更快反应。大脑无时无刻不在寻找并识别pattern。什么是pattern？「Discernible regularity in the world or in a manmade design. The elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.」而有趣的是，大脑对于图像、数字、音乐、游戏等形式中出现的pattern，表现出了极为矛盾的态度：期待相似又熟悉的出现，但又讨厌一味的重复。

3、pattern在游戏中的例子
4、大脑为什么期待相似pattern但又讨厌一味重复
5、如何运用

1. The brain is good at cutting out the irrelevant.
2. People dislike chaos. We like order - not regimented order, but order with a bit of texture or variation to it. For example, there's a long tradition in art history of observing that many paintings use a system of order called the golden section, which is basically just a way of dividing up the space on the painting into boxes of different proportions. It tuns out that doing so makes the painting appear "prettier" to us.
3. There's some hightly ordered music that doesn't appeal to most of us either. A lot of folks say that the strain of jazz known as bebop is just noise.
4. Noise is any pattern we don't understand.
5. Once we see a pattern we delight in tracing it and in seeing it reoccur.



Any of the five senses may directly observe patterns. Conversely, abstract patterns in science, mathematics, or language may be observable only by analysis. Direct observation in practice means seeing visual patterns, which are widespread in nature and in art. Visual patterns in nature are often chaotic, never exactly repeating, and often involve fractals. Natural patterns include spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tilings, cracks, and those created by symmetries of rotation and reflection. Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure;[1] indeed, mathematics can be seen as the search for regularities, and the output of any function is a mathematical pattern. Similarly in the sciences, theories explain and predict regularities in the world.

In art and architecture, decorations or visual motifs may be combined and repeated to form patterns designed to have a chosen effect on the viewer. In computer science, a software design pattern is a known solution to a class of problems in programming. In fashion, the pattern is a template used to create any number of similar garments.

「Why getting it wrong is the future of design」

进化的本质：复制、复制、大量复制，然后变异，适者生存，进化稳定成为新的基准线。

创新和这个没有太大的区别，每天都有人高举旗帜喊出新的想法，如果被接受那么这个想法就不断自我复制。从diffusion of innovation的理论中，

而现在最大的关键点在于「怎么变异」。变异一词从另个角度其实就可以理解成犯错，在进化的过程中，所谓的突变就是遗传因子复制错了。
