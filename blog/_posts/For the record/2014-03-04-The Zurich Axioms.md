Worry is not a sickness but a sign of health. If you are not worried, you are not risking enough.

Always take your profit too soon.

When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray. Jump.

Human behaviour cannot be predicted. Distrust anyone who claims to know the future, however dimly.

Chaos is not dangerous until it begins to look orderly.

Avoid putting down roots. They impede motion.

A hunch can be trusted if it can be explained.（So true）

It is unlikely that God’s plan for the universe includes making you rich.

Optimism means expecting the best, but confidence means knowing how you will handle the worst. Never make a move if you are merely optimistic.

Disregard the majority opinion. It is probably wrong.

If it doesn’t pay off the first time forget it.

Long-range plans engender the dangerous belief that the future is under control. It is important never to take your own long-range plans, or other people’s, too seriously.
