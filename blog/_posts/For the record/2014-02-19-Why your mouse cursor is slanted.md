When the XEROX PARC machine was built, the cursor changed into a tilted arrow. It was found that, given the low resolution of the screens in those days, drawing a straight line and a line in the 45 degrees angle was easier to do and more recognizable than the straight cursor.

So pixel layout is the real reason. To make it vertical and still look smooth the cursor would have to be twice as wide. Also that most def. is 45ยบ.
