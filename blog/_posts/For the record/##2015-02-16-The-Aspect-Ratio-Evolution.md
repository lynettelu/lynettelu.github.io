1、各大网站对图片比例的使用对比（web+mobile）
2、主流笔记本+智能机屏幕比例对比
3、Portrait vs Landscape dilemma
3、结论

195x年开始的信息时代，最显著的特征是模拟技术转向数字技术。平面设计从以纸为媒介逐渐开始由电子设备主导，图片比率由于展示环境的物理变化而发生转变。

aspect ratio即宽高比，这里我们只讨论最常见的三大类：摄影、摄像和显示设备。

摄影最常见比率有：5:4、4:3、3:2，因135胶卷的制式3:2是摄影中的最主流比率。



Page orientation is the way in which a rectangular page is oriented for normal viewing. The two most common types of orientation are portrait and landscape. 

Page orientation is also used to describe the dimensions of a video display. The most common video display orientation is landscape mode, especially the 4:3 ratio, which is 4 units wide and 3 units tall, and the more recent 16:9 widescreen landscape display mode.

Portrait screen orientation is also used for computer displays, though less commonly than landscape, and is the most popular orientation for mobile devices. Portrait is preferred for editing page-layout work, in order to view the entire page on the screen at once without wasted space along the sides, and for script-writing, legal work (in drafting contracts etc.), and other applications where it is useful to see a maximum number of lines of text. It is also common in public information displays.

The very first use of page orientation for Xerox Alto is portrait. Since "...the portrait display faded away while common landscape-display televisions were appropriated for use as an inexpensive early microcomputer display."
